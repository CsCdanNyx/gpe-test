2008-37:Prefix expression evaluation
Time Limit: 30 sec
Description
Evaluate a given prefix arithmetic expression that consists of postive integer constants and binary operators +, -, *, /, and %. The meanings of the operators are standard. In particular, / and % are integer division for quotient and remainder, respectively. In case the expression is an illegal prefix expression, report it as "illegal".

You may assume that the expression contains only digits, spaces, and the five operators mentioned above.

Input
The input consists of multiple datasets, followed by a line which contains only a single ‘.’ (period). Each dataset represents a test data. Each dataset contains a prefix expression. The size of each line of an expression will be at most 1024. Each symbol or number is separated by at least one space.

Output
For each case, the output should indicate the calculation result of the input prefix expression. If the input expression is illegal, the output is the string “illegal”.

Sample Input
- * + 23 % 45 10 6 / 77 12
+ * 234 56
.

Sample Output
162
illegal


Hint
- * + 23 % 45 10 6 / 77 12

is the prefix expression of the following statement

{[23+(45%10)]*6}-(77/12)
